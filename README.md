### What it is

This toolkit aims to be an all-in-one solution for post-installation, expediting your Arch setup. It's offered as *use at your own risk* type of thing, without much support. You will have to rely on yourself and your own knowledge and ability to do research for your specific setup.

### How to get it

First off let me say that everything this awesome toolkit provides is and will forever be optional and up to you, the user. It will never force anything on you. & That's a promise.
